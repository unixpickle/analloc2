# Another Allocator?

I want to create a multi-purpose allocator, not just for memory but for any numerically-addressed resource! This could be file descriptors, I/O ports, physical memory, or something I haven't even conceived of yet.

# Usage

I am currently rewriting the allocator for version 1.0.0. When this rewrite is complete, I will add documentation to this project.

# Benchmarks

See [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md).

# TODO
